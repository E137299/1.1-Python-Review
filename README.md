## Apple Distribution on a Field Trip
**Objective**: Write a Python script to determine how many apples each student will get and how many apples will remain in the basket after distributing them evenly.

### Instructions:
**Input Collection**

- Prompt the user to enter the number of students(𝑁) on the field trip.
- Prompt the user to enter the total number of apples  (𝐾) collected by the students.

**Calculation**
- Determine how many apples each student will receive, and
calculate how many apples will remain in the basket after distributing the apples evenly amongst the students.

**Output**

- Print a sentence stating the number of apples each student will receive.
- Print a second sentence stating the number of apples that will remain in the basket.

## Elapsed Time Calculation
**Objective**: Write a Python script to determine how many full hours and full minutes have elapsed since midnight given a number of seconds.

###Instructions:

**Input Collection**

- Prompt the user to enter the number of seconds 
(𝑁) that have elapsed since midnight.

**Calculation**

- Convert the total seconds into full hours and remaining minutes.
    - There are 60 seconds in an minute.
    - There are 60  minutes in an hour.

**Output**

- The program should print three numbers separated by ":"s.: the number of hours, the number of minutes (between 0 and 1339) and the number of seconds(between 0 and 59).

    Format: hh:mm: ss
    - Example:
        - 3661 seconds --> 1:1:1
        - 54545 seconds --> 15:9:5
