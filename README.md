## Elapsed Time Calculation
**Objective**: Write a Python script to determine how many full hours and full minutes have elapsed since midnight given a number of seconds.

###Instructions:

**Input Collection**

- Prompt the user to enter the number of seconds 
(𝑁) that have elapsed since midnight.

**Calculation**

- Convert the total seconds into full hours and remaining minutes.
    - There are 60 seconds in an minute.
    - There are 60  minutes in an hour.

**Output**

- The program should print three numbers separated by ":"s.: the number of hours, the number of minutes (between 0 and 1339) and the number of seconds(between 0 and 59).

    Format: hh:mm: ss
    - Example:
        - 3661 seconds --> 1:1:1
        - 54545 seconds --> 15:9:5
